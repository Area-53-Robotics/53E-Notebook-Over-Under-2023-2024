    53E grew greatly as a team last season, on both the building side, and the programming side. We struggled a lot with getting a functional bot together, but in the end our bot was able to perform all of the tasks required for the Spin Up season. This difficulty was due to both our inexperience and lack of planning. We did not plan our designs before building, we simply starting putting parts together. We did use CAD to a certain extent, but not to the point where we had a 1 to 1 mirror of our bot digitally. We would often be trying to get our bot functional even during the tournament. This meant we were constantly behind, and meant that our bot was not as tuned as it could have been, and also meant that we did not have enough time for driver practice and autonomous testing.

  For our code we also had mixed success. We did have some major successes. We managed to use git and Github to manage our code, which let us have two programmers work together. As far as I know, this is the first time in the club's history this has worked successfully. However, we did not meet some of the goals we set at the beginning of the year. We wanted to implement odometry to be able to make absolute movements in the autonomous period, but we were never able to get it to a usable state. It required a level of time and testing that we could not dedicate with a nonfunctional robot.

  Overall, I think that we are ready to go into next season much better prepared. Our team is much more experienced with not just CAD, but the general design process in general. We are considering implementing a system where our builders are required to plan their builds out in CAD before they build. This will help us spot problems before we spend time assembling, and overall means that our systems will fit better together.

  I also think that we can successfully implement odometry this season. Not only do I understand the concepts much better, but I have a near working implementation already. Whether we have the time to tune it is something we will have to consider in the future.
