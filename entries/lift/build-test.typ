  //The lifting lever (or arm) was completely built with the exception of custom
  //lexan hooks. Mount points for the arm and pneumatics were completely built. The
  //design was assembled completely. It was decided to rebuild the mount points to
  //increase structural stability.

  //The mount points for the arm were completely rebuilt. The mount points for the
  //pneumatics were partially built and assembled. It was decided that Alan would
  //finish building the mount points outside of practice.
